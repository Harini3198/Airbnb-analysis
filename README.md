# Airbnb Analysis
## Using streamlit creating an interactive geo visualization and other type of charts for airbnb data

### In this project user can visualize the data using plots like bar chart, geospatial, pie chart and table of the airbnb data to gain idea about pricing, room availability and types of rooms in each country.

## Steps to follow
### Firstly get the airbnb data which will be in a json format
### Extract only needed columns, convert and save it into a csv file or excel file and then convert the file into dataframe using pandas
### Clean the file by deleting unwanted data like Null values and apply some logical queries to convert the data into a meaningful one
### To understand the data, we can analyse it using PowerBI application
### Using plotly, display the data into a chart format and geospatial visualizations. Make it more interactive
### Display the output in a streamlit application
